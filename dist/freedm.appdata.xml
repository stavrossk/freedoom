      FreeDM is a fast-paced set of levels designed for multiplayer
      deathmatches, part of the Freedoom project.  Challenge your
      friends to the most torturous test of their abilities as you
      navigate through 32 levels stalking and hunting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Freedoom project aims to produce three base-game data files
      (IWADs) for Doom-compatible engines.  With it comes the
      capability to also play the wide range of mods created for Doom
      by a vibrant community.  FreeDM is fully compatible with Doom II
      mods.
