This directory contains some files that should be useful for system
installations on Unix-like operating systems, including desktop
entries, AppData XML files, and a shell script to run Freedoom in a
simple manner.

Unless otherwise noted, these files should be considered public domain
material and not subject to the usual Freedoom license terms.
